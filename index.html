    <h2><b><u>My Skills</u></b></h2>
    <ol>
        <li><b><u>Problem Solving-</u></b> This is a skill that has proven very
                  useful when having to think on your feet especially when fitting products
                 on site because if something diddnt quite work like it was designed to and 
                 you are hundreds of miles from the factory then you would have to come 
                 up with a solution that not only made the product fit but also that 
                 was in keeping with the design of the product so that the client would still
                 be pleased with the result.
         </li>
         <br/>
        <li><b><u>Adaptability-</u></b> This entertwines nicely with the previous skill
                  because while coming up with a solution to ay problems this may involve having 
                 to adapt your skill set in order to overcome the problem for example potentially 
                 having to move any plug sockets or sorting plumbing out when fitting kitchens 
                 so you had to be able to adapt to whatever was thrown your way.
        </li>
        <br/>
        <li><b><u>Teamwork-</u></b> This is also a very useful skill that i believe i have 
                  as i believe that my strong working relationships has got me to where i am today
                  as on tpugh days for either you or your collegues you can be there to help motivate
                   them or even entertain each other so that work becomes a fun place to be so without 
                   teamwork nothing would ever get done. 
        </li>
        <br/> 
        <li><b><u>Leadership-</u></b>This is another useful skill i believe i have gained through my 
                 experieces producing and fitting joinery becuase if we were working on a kitchen as 
                 a team then I would have to take charge to ensure that everbody was working to their 
                full potential and that the job was done to a high standard.
